The ideal metaprogramming framework reads in code in one of several
input notations, analyzes it, and generates output in one of several
output notations.  The input notations supported are the curly-brace-style
and the LISP-parens-style.  The analysis handles plain types, parameterized
types, and [flavored types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/ideal/master/documentation/type-flavors.txt).&nbsp;
The output notations include Java, JavaScript, interpreter and pretty-printer.

The ideal metaprogramming framework is an experiment and a work in progress.
Features are missing and not yet implemented; there is currently
very little documentation.
