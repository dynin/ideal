This is not an officially supported Google product.

The ideal metaprogramming framework is an experiment and a work in progress.

Features are missing and not yet implemented; there is no documentation
to speak of.

The code is in half-bootstrapped form: the library and the runtime are
written in a custom notation, while translator is written in Java.

You can't do anything useful with it, yet.&nbsp; To track the developments
and be notified when the project will reach a more mature state, subscribe to
[the announcements mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/ideal-announce).
