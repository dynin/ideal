Here Be Dragons.

The ideal metaprogramming framework reads in code in one of several
input notations, analyzes it, and generates output in one of several
output notations.  The input notations supported are the curly-brace-style
and the LISP-parens-style.  The analysis handles plain types, parametrized
types, and flavored types (described in type-flavors.txt).  The output
notations include Java, JavaScript, interpreter and pretty-printer.

To read the ideal source code: browse library and runtime directories.
The best place to start is library/elements.i; the "library" describes
the core interfaces, the "runtime" includes implementations.

The ideal notation was designed to be easily readable by a programmer who
is familiar with Java or C#.  Here's quick overview of the ideal-specific
features:

  * Comments can be prefixed with "--"
  * Type declarations are introduced with a "kind".  In addition to "class",
    "interface" and "enum", there are "concepts", "datatypes" and other kinds.
    They are similar to "interfaces".
  * Supertypes are part of type body declaration and can be prefixed with
    "extends", "implements" and "refines".
  * For declaring parametrized types, square brackets are used instead of
    angle brackets.
  * For declaring variables, a colon is used to distinguish declaration from
    assignment. Type can be inferred, and by default the variable is
    immutable (final).  "foo : 68" is equivalent to "final int foo = 68";
    an error is reported if "foo" is already defined in scope. To declare
    a mutable variable, prefix with "var"; assignment is done with "=".
  * For an overview of type flavors (introduced with keywords "readonly",
    "writeonly", "mutable", "immutable", "deeply_immutable", "any", "pure")
    see documentation/type-flavors.txt

The LALR(1) grammar for the ideal notation can be found in
ideal/development/parsers/base_parser.cup

Building and running ideal is easy on a Unix-like system (tested on Linux
and Mac OS X.)  The dependencies are: JDK, JSR 305 annotations, JUnit4,
Google Gson, JavaCUP.  AppEngine SDK is needed if you want to build and run
the Coach app.

To create the thirdparty directory and fetch all the dependencies, run
bin/fetch-thirdparty.sh from the top-level directory.  In addition, you'll
need to create a symlink from thirdparty/jdk to the JDK home directory (such as
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_60.jdk/Contents/Home on Mac OS X.)
It should be possible to invoke the Java compiler via thirdparty/jdk/bin/javac.

Make is currently used to build and run ideal.  Default target builds
the "create" tool, bootstraps library.elements, analyzes it and prints it out.
Targets "hello" and "circle" execute respective code from showcase directive.
"12" executes tests/12.i. The targets "generate_library" and "generate_runtime"
generate Java source code from library and runtime, respectively.
The targets "test_library" and "test_runtime" test that the code
compiles.  The targets "bootstrap_library" and "bootstrap_runtimeb" bootstrap
the code by overwriting the files in bootstrapped directory.
