  The ideal metaprogramming framework
</title>
<p>
  The <b>ideal metaprogramming framework</b> reads in code in one of several
  input notations, analyzes it, and generates output in one of several
  output notations.&nbsp; The input notations supported are the curly-brace-style
  and the LISP-parens-style.&nbsp; The analysis handles plain types, parameterized
  types, and <a

  types</a>.&nbsp;
  The output notations include Java, JavaScript, interpreter and documentation generator.&nbsp;
</p>

<p class='indented'>If your project involves <b>code generation</b>,
  ideal wants to be the ideal system for you.
</p>

<p>
  The ideal framework comes with a native programming language that exposes the full power
  of the system.&nbsp;  It is partially bootstrapped: a large portion of ideal is written in
  ideal.&nbsp;  The ideal language has a simple grammar and an advanced type system.

  If you are interested in <b>programming language design</b>,
  ideal wants to be the ideal system for you.
</p>

<p>
  The ideal language is incrementally adaptable by adding extensions
  to the ideal framework.&nbsp;  It was designed to experiment with
  language evolution driven by language users.

  If you want to <b>adapt the language to the problem</b>
  rather than the problem to the language,
  ideal wants to be the ideal system for you.

<p>
  Currently, the ideal metaprogramming framework is a work in progress.&nbsp;
  Not all features are implemented, and documentation is sparse.&nbsp;
  However, you can
  <a href='urn:ideal:ideal.documentation.quickstart'>start reading the code</a> now.
  All of ideal is open source and is released under a
  <a href="urn:ideal:ideal.documentation.license">BSD-style license</a>.
