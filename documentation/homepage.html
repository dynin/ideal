<p>
  The <b>ideal metaprogramming framework</b> reads in code in one of several
  input notations, analyzes it, and generates output in one of several
  output notations.&nbsp; The input notations supported are the curly-brace-style
  and the LISP-parens-style.&nbsp; The analysis handles plain types, parameterized
  types, and <a

  types</a>.&nbsp;
  The output notations include Java, JavaScript, interpreter and documentation generator.&nbsp;
</p>

<p class='right'>If your project involves <b>code generation</b>,
  ideal wants to be the ideal system for you.
</p>

<p>
  The ideal framework comes with a native programming language that exposes the full power
  of the system.&nbsp;  It is partially bootstrapped: a large portion of ideal is written in
  ideal.&nbsp;  The ideal language has a simple grammar and an advanced type system.

  ideal wants to be the ideal system for you.

<p>
If for your project you find that you need to <b>adapt the language to the problem</b>
rather than the problem to the language, ideal is ideal for you.

<p>
The ideal metaprogramming framework is an experiment and a work in progress.&nbsp;
Features are missing and not yet implemented; there is currently
very little documentation.
