  This document provides instructions for installing and running
  the ideal metaprogramming framework.
  For an introduction to the ideal source notation, please read

  For description of the directory layout, read

  <dt>Step 1: Clone GitHub Repository.</dt>
  <dd>Go to the <a href='https://github.com/dynin/ideal'>GitHub project page</a>,
      and <a href='https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository'>follow
      the instructions</a> to create a local copy of the repo.

  <dt>Step 2: Install JDK.</dt>

  <dt>Step 3: Download Dependencies.</dt>
  <dd>
  Building and running ideal is easy on a Unix-like system (tested on Mac OS X
  and Linux.)  The dependencies, besides the JDK, are
  <a href='https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=305'>JSR 305</a> annotations and
  <a href='http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/'>JavaCUP</a>.
  <a href='https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads'>AppEngine SDK</a>
  and <a href='https://github.com/google/gson'>Google Gson</a>
  are needed if you want to build and run the Coach app.

  <br/>
  Before running ideal, you need to create and populate the
  <span class='q'>thirdparty</span> directory.
  To do that and fetch all the dependencies, run
  <span class='q'>bin/fetch-thirdparty.sh</span> from the top-level directory.
  In addition, you'll need to create a symlink from
  <span class='q'>thirdparty/jdk</span> to the JDK home directory (such as
  <span class='q'>/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_171.jdk/Contents/Home</span>
  on Mac OS X.)  It should be possible to invoke the Java compiler via
  <span class='q'>thirdparty/jdk/bin/javac</span>.

  </dd>

  <dt>Step 4: Watch It Run!</dt>
  <dd>
  Make is currently used to build and run ideal.  Default target builds
  the <span class='q'>create</span> tool, bootstraps
  <span class='q'>ideal.library.elements</span>, analyzes it and prints it out.
  Targets <span class='q'>hello</span> and
  <span class='q'>circle</span> execute respective code from showcase directory.
  <span class='q'>12</span> executes <span class='q'>tests/12.i</span>.
  The targets <span class='q'>generate_library</span> and <span class='q'>generate_runtime</span>
  generate Java source code from library and runtime, respectively.
  The targets <span class='q'>test_library</span> and
  <span class='q'>test_runtime</span> test that the code
  compiles.  The targets <span class='q'>bootstrap_library</span>
  and <span class='q'>bootstrap_runtime</span> bootstrap
  the code by overwriting the files in bootstrapped directory.
