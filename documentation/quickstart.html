<p>
  The ideal notation was designed to be easily readable by a programmer who
  is familiar with Java or C#.  Here's quick overview of the ideal-specific
  features:
</p>

<p>
  Type declarations are introduced with a <em>kind</em>.
  In addition to <span class='q'>class</span>, <span class='q'>interface</span>
  and <span class='q'>enum</span>, there are
  <span class='q'>concept</span>s, <span class='q'>datatype</span>s
  and other kinds, which can be read as interfaces.
  <span class='q'>namespace</span>, <span class='q'>package</span>,
  <span class='q'>project</span> any <span class='q'>module</span> declare
  types with no instance members.
  <span class='q'>singleton</span> declares a type with exactly one instance.
</p>

<p>
  Supertypes are part of type body declaration and can be prefixed with
  <span class='q'>extends</span>, <span class='q'>implements</span> and
  <span class='q'>refines</span>.  By convention, the first constructs
  in type declarations should be supertypes.
</p>

<p>
  For declaring parameterized types, square brackets are used instead of
  angle brackets.  You can use <span class='q'>()</span> and
  <span class='q'>[]</span> interchangeably for procedure calls,
  groupings, and parameterized type declarations; although they must be matched.
  By convention, <span class='q'>[]</span> are used for parameterized types and
  collection access/initializer.
</p>

<p>
  For declaring variables, a colon is used to distinguish declaration from
  assignment. Type can usually be inferred, and by default the variable is
  immutable (final).  <span class='q'>foo&nbsp;:&nbsp;68</span> is equivalent to
  <span class='q'>final int foo = 68</span> in Java; an error is reported if
  <span class='q'>foo</span> is already defined in scope. To declare
  a mutable variable, prefix with <span class='q'>var</span>,
  such as <span class='q'>var string name : "foo"</span>.
  Assignment is done with <span class='q'>=</span>.
</p>

<p>
  For an overview of type flavors that are introduced with keywords
  <span class='q'>readonly</span>, <span class='q'>writeonly</span>,
  <span class='q'>mutable</span>, <span class='q'>immutable</span>,
  <span class='q'>deeply_immutable</span>, <span class='q'>any</span>,
  <span class='q'>pure</span>
  see <a href='urn:ideal:ideal.documentation.type_flavors'>the document on
  the topic</a>.
</p>

<p>
  In constructor invokation, <span class='q'>new</span> follows the type
  declaration, as in <span class='q'>hash_set[string].new()</span>.
  List initializers are expressed as <span class='q'>[ foo, bar, baz ]</span>.
  To create a one-element list, use a trailing comma as in
  <span class='q'>[ foo, ]</span>.
  (Just <span class='q'>[ foo ]</span> is equivalent to
  <span class='q'>( foo )</span> and is a grouping construct. )
</p>

<p>
  To check whether a value is an instance of a type, use the
  <span class='q'>is</span> operator, such as
  <span class='q'>if (foo is string) {...</span>
  The <span class='q'>is_not</span> operator
  performs the check and returns the opposite result.
  There are two cast operators: <span class='q'>.&gt;</span> is a "soft" cast that
  can never fail (such as converting a type to a supertype), while <span class='q'>!&gt;</span>
  is a "hard" cast that can fail (such as when converting a supertype to subtype.)
  Casts can be omitted for local variables where they are provably redundant.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Comment lines are prefixed with <span class='q'>--</span></li>
  <li>Documentation comments are prefixed with <span class='q'>---</span></li>
  <li>String concatenation operator is <span class='q'>++</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
  In the publication mode, curly braces are omitted in favor of consistent indentation.&nbsp;
  Underscores in indentifiers are replaced with spaces,
  and the dot is replaced with a bullet symbol, so
  <span class='q'>the_list_value.size</span> becomes
  <span class='qb'>the list value &bull; size</span>&nbsp;
