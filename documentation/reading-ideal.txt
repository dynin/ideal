Variable:

foo : expression();

Use : instead of = for initialization.
Type usually can be inferred.
Immutable (final) by default; to make mutable (variable), add var modifier:
var string name : "foo";

Brackets:

You can use () and [] interchangeably for procedure calls, groupings, and
parametrized type declarations.  (Although they must be matched).

By convention, [] are used for paramterized types and collection access/initializer.

List initializers are expressed as [ foo, bar, baz ].  To create a one-element list,
use a trailing comma as in [ foo, ].  (Just [ foo ] is equivalent to ( foo ) and
is a grouping construct. )

new()

as; is; is_not

supertypes: declared using declarations in the type declration body, such as
class string {
  extends data;
  By convention, the first constructs in type declarations should be supertypes.
