Variable:

foo : expression();

Use : instead of = for initialization.
Type usually can inferred.
Immutable (final) by default; to make mutable (variable), add var modifier:
var integer index : 0;

Brackets:

You can use () and [] interchangeably for procedure calls, groupings, and
parametrized type declarations.  (Although they must be matched).

By convention, [] are used for paramterized types and collection access/initializer.

List initializers are expressed as [ foo, bar, baz ].  To create a one-element list,
use a trailing comma as in [ foo, ].  (Just [ foo ] is equivalent to ( foo ) and
is a grouping construct. )
