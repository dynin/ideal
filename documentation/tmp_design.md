Design Goals
------------

There are several design goals for the ideal language and runtime.

 * Readable by programmers familiar with Java/JavaScript.
 * Targetable to multiple platforms
 * Enables building high-performance distributed applications
 * Do not distinguish between builtin and user-defined abstractions
 * Facilitates static checking
 * Improves security of programs
 * Enables collaboration between creators in different roles
 * Timeless: focuses on abstractions that won't be obsolete

Summary: high fidelity programming.
