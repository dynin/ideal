  Type Flavors
</title>

<p>
  Ideal notation allows developer to specify the type precisely yet without
  boilerplate code, using  parameterized types (generics) as well as
  <em>type flavors.</em>
  Like generics, type flavors define a family of related types.
  Unlike generics, the family is finite; there are currently six type flavors:
  <span class='q'>readonly</span>,
  <span class='q'>writeonly</span>,
  <span class='q'>mutable</span>,
  <span class='q'>immutable</span>,
  <span class='q'>deeply_immutable</span>,
  <span class='q'>mutable</span>,
  <span class='q'>any</span>.
  The type flavor prefixes the typename; it is possible to combine both type
  flavors and type parameters, with a declaration such as
  <span class='q'>readonly list[mutable value]</span>.
</p>

<p>
  The <span class='q'>readonly</span> flavor is equivalent to <span class='q'>const</span>
  in C and C++: it specifies that
  the only legal operations on the entity are the ones that don’t change its
  state. In the list example, you can access the elements but not set them&mdash;although
  some other code may change the list state. The <span class='q'>immutable</span>
  flavor is a stronger contract: it specifies that the state of the entity is guaranteed to
  never change.  In the list case, the state of the list is frozen, but you can
  modify the state of the elements of the list.  The <span class='q'>deeply_immutable</span>
  is a stronger contract still: it specifies that the state of the value is
  transitively immutable.
  The <span class='q'>deeply_immutable list</span> is used to specify that neither
  the list nor any of the entities that it references, directly and indirectly, will change its
  state.
</p>

<p>
  The <span class='q'>writeonly</span> flavor specifies that the only legal operations
  are the ones that write to the entity.  The <span class='q'>writeonly list</span>
  supports
  <span class='q'>append()</span> and
  <span class='q'>insert()</span> but not
  <span class='q'>get()</span>.
  The <span class='q'>mutable</span> flavor supports all the operations; it is
  the default flavor, and the modifier can be omitted.
  The <span class='q'>any</span> flavor is
  useful when either <span class='q'>readonly</span> or <span class='q'>writeonly</span>
  or any other flavor will do.
</p>

<p>
  For a given type, the supertyping relationship of its flavors is as follows:
</p>

<pre>
                              any
                              ^ ^
                             /   \
                            /     \
                      readonly   writeonly
                        ^  ^       ^
                       /    \     /
                      /      \   /
                immutable   mutable
                    ^
                   /
            deeply_immutable</pre>

<p>
  When methods are defined, they can have type flavor as a suffix.  In this case,
  the method applies to the appropriately flavored type.  (Prefix <span class='q'>pure</span>
  specifies a pure function maps to readonly type flavor.) Consider
  the declaration:
</p>

<pre>
interface list[element]
  element get(integer index) readonly;
  void append(element the_element) writeonly;</pre>

<p>
  It is equivalent to the following six declarations:
</p>

<pre>
interface any_list[element];

interface readonly_list[element]
  extends any_list[element];
  element get(integer index);

interface writeonly_list[element]
  extends any_list[element];
  void append(element the_element);

interface mutable_list[element]
  extends readonly_list[element], writeonly_list[element];

interface immutable_list[element]
  extends readonly_list[element];

interface deeply_immutable_list[element]
  extends immutable_list[element];</pre>

<p>
  The introduction of type flavors makes practical the strict adherence to
  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle'>Liskov
  substitution principle</a>.  This is illustrated by elegant solutions to
  two challenges: the circle-ellipse problem and the variance in collection
  types.
</p>

<p>
  In the case of the
  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle-ellipse_problem'>circle-ellipse problem</a>,
  the challenge is how circle can handle mutation operations from the ellipse
  that might make axis unequal.  The ideal solution is simple:
  <span class='q'>circle</span>, instead of inheriting from
  <span class='q'>ellipse</span>, should inherit from
  <span class='q'>readonly ellipse</span>.  Then it should support
  the fetching of width and height, but not the mutation that might turn
  a circle into an an ellipse.  (The code for this example can be found in
  <a href='https://github.com/dynin/ideal/blob/master/showcase/circle.i'>showcase/circle.i</a>;
  <span class='qb'>make circle</span> runs it.)
</p>

<p>
  With the
  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)'>variance
  in collection types</a>, the challenge is to define a subtyping relationship on
  generic collection types such as list. Given that
  <span class='q'>string</span> is an <span class='q'>object</span>,
  is <span class='q'>list[string]</span> a
  <span class='q'>list[object]</span>?  That depends on the flavor of the list:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class='q'>readonly list[string]</span> is a
      <span class='q'>readonly list[object]</span></li>
  <li><span class='q'>writeonly list[object]</span> is a
      <span class='q'>writeonly list[string]</span></li>
  <li><span class='q'>mutable list[string]</span> is not a
      <span class='q'>mutable list[object]</span>, nor the other way around</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This is a common pattern, and ideal type system supports it directly: by adding
  the <span class='q'>combivariant</span> modifier to the type parameter (as in
  <span class='q'>interface list[combivariant value element]</span>) all the
  subtyping relationships among different flavors are setup.
  It is also possible to use <span class='q'>covariant</span>
  and <span class='q'>contravariant</span> modifiers,
  similar to <span class='q'>in</span> and <span class='q'>out</span> modifiers in C#.
  (In the current implementation, variance annotations are not fully supported.)
